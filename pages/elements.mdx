# Types

## Block Elements

Block elements are elements that take up the full width of their parent container. They are typically used to create structural layout.

Block elements will automatically create a new line before and after the element, and any other elements that come before or after it will be displayed on a new line.

<TypeBlock />
<ColumnsList groups={blockList} />

### Most common

#### main

The main topic of the page.

- unique
- Repeated content across website like logo, navigation... shouldn't be included

#### header

May contains introductory content, navigation, logo, search form, author name...

- Should define the role="banner" when it is the site-wide header (not a descendant of `aside`, `article`, `main`, `nav`, `section`)
- Can contain a h1 - h6 but it is not required.

#### aside

It only indirectly related to the document's main content.

- Can be used inside a descendant such has `article`, `main`

#### footer

The footer for its nearest ancestor. It generally contains information about the author, copyright or links related to the section.

- If the ancestor is the body, it applies to the entire page. `article`, `main`

#### section

A generic sectioning element. Used only if it cannot be defined by a more specific element (aside, article)

- Should contain a heading `h1 - h6`
- If used to create a block/wrapper, use a `div` instead.

#### article

Self-contained composition ex: a post, an article, a blog entry, a product, a comment...

- Can have multiple article.
- It should include a heading `h1 - h6` as a child
- When be nested inside another `article`. Ex: comments marked as `article` of an `article`
- The author info can be provided through the `address` element
- The publication date can be described using `<time datetime="...">`

#### div

A generic container. It offers no context. It is used to easily style elements.

- Used only if no other semantic element can be used.

#### nav

Provide navigation links (menus, tables, contents...).

- Can have multiple nav (should be labeled properly)
- It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a nav element.
- Can wrap a p containing a lot of links.
- Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to label the nav element.
- Use `aria-current="page"` to indicate the current page.

#### dl-dt-dd

A description list. It represents a list of groups of terms. It is normally used in conjunction with: titles (`dt`) and descriptions (`dd`)

- Can have multiple title and description (for 1 `dl`)
- Can use `divs` inside a `dl`

## Inline Elements

Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not create a new block formatting context.

**Vertical spacing won't be applied to inline elements**, meaning that if you add vertical padding to the element, it won't create a gap between the elements above and below it.
