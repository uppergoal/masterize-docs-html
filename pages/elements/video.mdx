# Video

Used to embed video content on a web page. The video can be played directly in the browser, without the need for a separate plugin or application.

The basic syntax is as follows:

```html
<video src="video_file.mp4" controls>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

You can specify multiple sources for the video by using the `<source>` element, allowing the browser to choose the best format for the user's device.

```html
<video>
  <source src="video_file.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="video_file.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="video_file.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

Here is an example of a complete HTML5 video player with multiple sources, captions and poster image:

```html
<video controls width="640" height="360" poster="poster_image.jpg">
  <source src="video_file.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="video_file.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="video_file.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
  <track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

## Common Attributes

### src, controls, width, height

The src attribute specifies the URL of the video file to be embedded. The controls attribute displays the default video controls, such as play/pause and volume, within the browser.

You can also specify the width and height of the video using the width and height attributes, respectively.

<video src="video_file.mp4" controls width="640" height="360">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### track

The track element is used to specify timed text tracks for media elements. The text tracks are used for subtitles, captions, and other text-based information that is displayed over the video or audio.

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="video_file.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

### poster

You can also set the default poster image of the video by using the poster attribute.

```html
<video
  src="video_file.mp4"
  controls
  width="640"
  height="360"
  poster="poster_image.jpg"
>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

## Events

### onplay, onpause, onended

The onplay, onpause, and onended events are triggered when the video starts playing, pauses, and ends, respectively.

```html
<video
  src="video_file.mp4"
  controls
  width="640"
  height="360"
  onplay="myFunction()"
>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

## Libraries

Open-source libraries like `video.js`, `plyr.js`, and many more that can be used to customize the default video player.
