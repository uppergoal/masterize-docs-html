# Tables

A table in HTML is used to present data in a tabular format. It consists of rows and columns, with the data being organized into cells. The <table> element is used to create a table, and the <tr> element is used to create rows, while the <td> element is used to create columns. You can also use the <th> element to create a header row or column, which is typically displayed in a bolder font and centered within the cell. Here's an example:

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    My table title
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Age</th>
      <th scope="col">Location</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>25</td>
      <td>New York</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>London</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charlie</td>
      <td>35</td>
      <td>Paris</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  <tfooter>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">The footer</td>
    </tr>
  </tfooter>
</table>
```

The scope attribute is used to specify the cells that a <th> element applies to in an HTML table. The <th> element is used to create a cell that is a header, and the scope attribute is used to specify which cells in the table the header cell applies to.

## Caption

You can give meaning to a table by defining a caption:

## Span (colspan & rowspan)

The rowspan/colspan attribute is used to specify the number of rows/cols a cell should span or merge. It is used within the <td> or <th> element, and its value is the number of rows/cols that the cell should span.

## thead, tbody, tfooter

The <thead>, <tbody>, <tfooter> element is used to group the content in an HTML table.

The purpose of those elements is to provide a way to group and style the header content in a table.
