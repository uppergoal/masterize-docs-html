## Text Block Elements

<ColumnsList groups={blockList} />

### h1-h6

Heading elements represent six levels of section headings. `h1` is the highest section level and `h6` is the lowest.

- `h1` is the main title of the page. **It should be unique on the page**.
- Each heading level represent a level in a **table of content**. the bigger the number, the lower the level.

```html
<h1>Main header of the page</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Title of the section</h2>
  <article><h3>Title of this article</h3></article>
  <article><h3>Title of this article</h3></article>
</section>
<section><h2>...</h2></section>
```

### p

Represents a paragraph.

- HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
- Screen-readers and other assistive technology provide shortcuts to let their users skip to the next or previous paragraph.
