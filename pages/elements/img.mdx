# Images

The `<img>` element is used to add an image to an HTML document.

- Doesn't have a closing tag
- The src can be relative or absolute

**Required attributes:**

- `src`: The URL of the image.
- `alt`: An alternative text for the image in case the image cannot be displayed for some reason or if someone cannot see the image (Screen reader).

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image" />
```

## Attributes

### Width and height

Specify the width and height of the image, in pixels.

- don't actually change the size of the image file
- It is recommended to explicitly set both to minimize the cumulative layout shit. _(A layout shift occurs when a visible element on a webpage changes its position because of another element)_

```html
<img
  src="image.jpg"
  alt="A description of the image"
  width="200"
  height="100"
/>
```

### Title

Provide additional information about the image. The text in the title attribute is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse is hovered over the image.

- an additional source of information (not a replacement for the alt attribute)

```html
<img
  src="image.jpg"
  alt="A description of the image"
  title="A more detailed description of the image"
/>
```

### Loading

Used to specify how the browser should handle the loading of an image. The attribute can have the following values:

| Value      | Description                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| s (defaul) | The browser should use its default behavior for loading the image.                         |
| lazy       | only load the image when it is near the viewport. (improving the performance)              |
| eager      | load the image immediately, regardless of whether it is visible or not. (important images) |

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image" loading="lazy" />
```

## Figure

Represent self-contained content, often with a caption, that can be referenced as a single unit from the main content of the webpage. This is useful for content that is intended to be reused, such as illustrations, diagrams, photos, code snippets, etc.

- typically used to contain images, charts, or other types of media.
- can be accompanied by a figcaption element, which is used to provide a caption or description for the content within the figure.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape" />
  <figcaption>A beautiful landscape in the mountains</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Improve performance

1. Reduce the file size of images.
1. Use lazy loading: Load images only when they are visible to the user. This can improve page load time and save bandwidth.
1. Use appropriate image file types: JPEGs are best for photographs, PNGs are best for graphics with transparent backgrounds, and GIFs are best for simple animations.
1. Specify image dimensions: By specifying the width and height of an image, the browser can reserve the appropriate space for it before it has loaded, which improves the overall layout of the page.
1. Minimize the number of images: Reduce the number of images used on the website. This can be done by using CSS effects, such as gradients, instead of images.
1. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN can help distribute the images to users from a location close to them, which can reduce load times.
1. Optimize images for mobile: Make sure images are optimized for mobile devices by compressing them and using appropriate file types.
